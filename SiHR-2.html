<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;img src="https://40.media.tumblr.com/11067b69cbd0d491032013f249ca06f2/tumblr_no2iutYVg01ss5n20o1_r6_400.png" /&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;&amp;ldquo;_____,&amp;rdquo; a voice interrupted your thoughts. Standing at the door of your Tokyo micro-apartment &amp;ndash; as your boyfriend refused to pass up quality and you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t give up being as close as possible to your universities without having to sell any of your organs &amp;ndash; Kuroo looked absolutely ragged.&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;&amp;ldquo;I hope you showered,&amp;rdquo; you yawned. Turning to the next page, you rubbed your eyes and decided to just close the textbook, making sure to bookmark the page before you placed it on your lap. &amp;ldquo;Hungry?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;Walking up to where you sat, an exhausted Kuroo grumbled, &amp;ldquo;I did,&amp;rdquo; as he pushed your bangs back and placed a quick kiss on your forehead, &amp;ldquo;and no, Ichisada-san brought everyone lunch today.&amp;rdquo; When he leaned back, putting a hand through his washed yet still unkempt hair, he sighed. &amp;ldquo;And now, to nap!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;&amp;ldquo;Chise-san? How does she manage to balance school &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; Bokuto &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; his doubly hyperactive little clone?! And &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; visit him, like, every waking moment?&amp;rdquo; you grumbled, flicking your hair back in place. [1]&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;&amp;ldquo;I like to call it dumb love.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;&amp;ldquo;How poetic,&amp;rdquo; you breathed, &amp;ldquo;I guess we&amp;rsquo;re smart lovers then?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;Kuroo gave you a grin, shrugging lazily as he knelt down to convert the couch into a bed.&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;&amp;ldquo;Well, welcome home.&amp;rdquo; Stretching your arms over your head, you braced yourself for the cushion to be pulled from beneath you. Nothing happened, though, and you craned your neck to observe Kuroo stare into the linen cabinet.&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;&amp;ldquo;Why are all the pillows naked?&amp;rdquo; he asked, pointing to the bare pillows which were carelessly shoved into the drawers.&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Awkward word choice&lt;/em&gt;, you thought, eyes narrowed. &amp;ldquo;I put the cases in the washer like you told me to.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;&amp;ldquo;I told you to wash all the pillow cases &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt; mine,&amp;rdquo; he said in a scolding tone. Groaning, he closed the drawer and proceeded to massage the bags under his eyes.&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;You remembered his odd bed habit. &amp;ldquo;Oh, right, sorry!&amp;rdquo; Biting your lower lip, you gave him an apologetic look. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m all over the place with this stupid course! The prof has us reading 50 page chapters a day with the warning that he could ambush us with a cumulative quiz whenever he feels like it!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s okay,&amp;rdquo; Kuroo yawned as he fell with a plump onto the couch. &amp;ldquo;But you&amp;rsquo;ll have to make it up to me,&amp;rdquo; eyes narrowed, he looked upon the messy living area, &amp;ldquo;somehow.&amp;rdquo; At that moment, he decided it would be easier on him to keep you away any from household errands&amp;hellip; at least, when you were without his supervision.&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;You snorted. &amp;ldquo;Later, okay?&amp;rdquo; you chuckled, waving the heavy text in front of you. Leaning your back onto the wall, you bended your knees and rested the book on top of them. The air from the slightly opened window blew a cool breeze between your legs, which you felt through your skirt.&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not asking for &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;!&amp;rdquo; he responded defensively. &amp;ldquo;I mean, &lt;em&gt;that&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/em&gt; always &lt;em&gt;nice&lt;/em&gt;, but it&amp;rsquo;s not something you barter &amp;ndash; not in our relationship!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;After you and Kuroo got accepted into the same university [2], he suggested living together to save money. He also worried you would drown in your own laundry, which had already proven itself as an actual threat to your existence. You were against it at first, and so was Tomoyo, but in the end you both knew it was probably for the best.&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;Your cousin had other things to worry about [3] than whether or not you and Kuroo acted on your passions &amp;ndash; although she still butted in every now and then &amp;ndash; and she could immediately tell after your first time by the look on Kuroo&amp;rsquo;s face. And you had practiced your poker face for hours, too, all for naught.&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;You shrugged the nostalgia aside, as there was time for that &lt;em&gt;after &lt;/em&gt;this chapter. &amp;ldquo;What do you have in mind then?&amp;rdquo; you asked mindlessly, getting back to your studies. Normally, you would&amp;rsquo;ve been suspicious of the silence that followed, but you were too busy trying to wrap your head around a concept that you didn&amp;rsquo;t notice a shift in weight on the mattress.&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;Suddenly, you felt rough hands seize your buttocks and strong arms encircle your legs. When you looked down, all you could see was messy hair popping out from under your skirt. You knew from the sensations that Kuroo was nestling his face in between your thighs, but you could practically &lt;em&gt;feel &lt;/em&gt;his smirk as he rested his chin on your groin.&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;KUROO!!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; you screamed, slamming your textbook shut in order to use the edge and whack the personal space invader over his perpetual bedhead.&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ow!&amp;rdquo; he yelped. Throwing the book to the ground, you tried to jerk him off of you, but only made his grip on your cheeks tighten. You lost balance and fell on your side, towards the wall. A leg flew up, which gave Kuroo enough time to poise himself, placing an inner thigh on each side of his head. You felt him puff his cheeks out in a pout. &amp;ldquo;You owe me pillows!&amp;rdquo; was his excuse. &amp;ldquo;And when are you going to call me by my first name?!&amp;rdquo; This reminded him of the time you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t even say his &lt;em&gt;last&lt;/em&gt; name, all those years ago.&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;Realizing your leg was in a convenient position, you raised it higher before axe-kicking him in the back and knocking the wind out of him. &amp;ldquo;Ahhh, _____, I swear I&amp;rsquo;m just going to rest here!&amp;rdquo; he groaned in pain. &amp;ldquo;No funny business, okay?&amp;rdquo; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="https://41.media.tumblr.com/b05938b1e56b459cdcb4b5ba1bd2d5ef/tumblr_no2iutYVg01ss5n20o1_400.png" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;&amp;ldquo;No, that&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;okay! How the hell do you expect me to study when you&amp;rsquo;re&amp;hellip; when you&amp;rsquo;re &lt;em&gt;there?!&lt;/em&gt; Get out or I&amp;rsquo;ll &lt;em&gt;throw&lt;/em&gt; you out of the apartment!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;Kuroo seemed to be ignoring you, tapping his fingers along your backside in thought. &amp;ldquo;Hmmm, I could get used to this. You know, these are &lt;em&gt;much &lt;/em&gt;softer than actual pillows. Something about the suppleness and curvature of your&amp;ndash;&lt;em&gt;mmph!&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; He was interrupted by the act of you squeezing your legs shut, crushing his skull with a combination of muscle and cellulite.&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;&amp;ldquo;Butsu kuroosu!&amp;rdquo; you hissed. [4]&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;That slip up was reminiscent of the past as well, and Kuroo snorted, releasing a quick cool puff of air onto your warmth. Feeling uncomfortable, and strangely enough, turned on, you tried your best to punish him but were already exhausted. In the midst of this odd one-sided battle, Kuroo ducked his chin as he tried his best to yank himself out of your death hold. He had not noticed that his retaliation would land his mouth onto your warmth and rub against it vigorously, though.&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ah!&amp;rdquo; you finally let out a soft moan. You slapped your hands over your mouth and cursed yourself for not doing it sooner.&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;As all of your strength had been focused on your hands and to calm your breathing, Kuroo poked his head out of your skirt to peer onto your face.&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;You avoided his gaze so you couldn&amp;rsquo;t see the big grin he had on, but you could sure as hell &lt;em&gt;tell&lt;/em&gt; he was enjoying this from the lack of complaints. You &lt;em&gt;had &lt;/em&gt;almost flattened his head, after all.&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;&amp;ldquo;You don&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; like you want to study anymore,&amp;rdquo; he chuckled. &amp;ldquo;In fact, I don&amp;rsquo;t think you &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; continue&amp;hellip; Not until I conclude my &amp;lsquo;funny business&amp;rsquo;&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="https://40.media.tumblr.com/265c66c510c968b5f2fad723b41f779e/tumblr_no2iutYVg01ss5n20o1_r2_400.png" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;You shook your head vigorously, but did not struggle when he peeled your already soaked panties off of you.&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;&amp;ldquo;Looks like we&amp;rsquo;re going to have to do another load of laundry,&amp;rdquo; he teased, tugging at your hips. You let him pull your whole body down along the couch and push your skirt up to clear the view of your folds.&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;Removing your hands, you craned your neck up to shout at the bedhead, &amp;ldquo;Y-you said we didn&amp;rsquo;t barter in our relationship!&amp;rdquo; You were just doing everything you could to avoid the inevitable, even resorting to petty remarks. And Kuroo knew just how your mind worked. Seeing the sight of his sly face hovering over your wetness, you let your head fall back down onto the couch, face as red as your first time, and honestly, &lt;em&gt;every other time&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;Wide awake now, Kuroo himself was on edge, so he decided to skip the usual banter and rush onto what he knew you both needed.&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;Kuroo kissed your naked pussy, once again causing you to stifle your gasps. He extended his tongue and licked you slowly, beginning at the bottom of your slit and working up to the top. His hands slid under you, holding your buttocks, slipping just the tip of his tongue between your outer lips. He ran it from the bottom of your opening to your clit, over and over, causing you to get wetter with each lap. You gave a halting moan and placed a hand on his head, gently holding him against you, curling your fingers through his unruly locks. He kissed your spread lips and breathed in your scent, tracing every fold of you with his lips and tongue. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="https://40.media.tumblr.com/e7fd6d8f33a75bcb4999db9da4f0fdd5/tumblr_no2iutYVg01ss5n20o1_r3_250.png" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;As he squeezed your ass and teased your swollen clit, you shook with laboured breath. When he curled his tongue up against your bud, you clamped your legs around him and let out a short cry, then a long one, trembling uncontrollably as he continued to lap you up.&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;The raven-haired man smiled into you, humming, before sliding one hand from your backside to your stomach. Your abdomen tightened under his hand as your second climax immediately approached. You thrashed, shaking to match the movement of his lips and tongue. You broke off into a full-throated cry of orgasm as your entire body convulsed, crushing your boyfriend&amp;rsquo;s head between your legs, though not on purpose this time. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t as tight as your death hold, but it was enough to get Kuroo moaning his own sounds of pleasure, but mostly pride.&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;He never stopped licking you, loving every minute of giving you pleasure. And until he felt you tug at his hair, he had almost forgotten to breathe. He raised his head slowly, licking his lips, listening to your frenzied breathing.&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;You helped yourself up, catching your breath as you looked across the room towards the television. It reflected your own disordered hair, which you promptly put back into place. You also saw Kuroo place a hand on your breast, and you couldn&amp;rsquo;t believe it until you looked down to him fondling you.&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;&amp;ldquo;Looks like we&amp;rsquo;ll have to wash the sheets again too,&amp;rdquo; he purred, as if to seduce you.&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s the third time this month already,&amp;rdquo; you sighed in frustration, giving him a glare. &amp;ldquo;Think about the water bill.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;Before you could push the hand away, his other hand seized your other breast. Irritated, you pushed him back. &amp;ldquo;Stop it!&amp;rdquo; you growled. &amp;ldquo;I have to study!&amp;rdquo; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="https://40.media.tumblr.com/116e57353a651c5dd021cc9f83553e3c/tumblr_inline_nle2cnXjpq1rowsv9_500.png" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;The surprised look on his face switched to one of amusement. With his fingers, he placed a strand of your hair behind your ear, swiftly putting his arm around you to pull you closer. He leaned in and kissed you deeply, positioning his hand under your arm to squeeze you again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="https://40.media.tumblr.com/d35271f2db812b388dee154eb18c0427/tumblr_inline_nle2cruvTR1rowsv9_500.png" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;Feeling the warm sensation of his lips, you kissed him back, tongue pressing against his.&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;Before you knew it, his naked body knelt before your own. You were completely breathless, feeling the warmth leave with Kuroo as he pulled away.&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;You shuddered.&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;He cupped your cheek and smirked, closing in on your breathless form. &amp;amp;##8220;What is it?&amp;rdquo; he asked.&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;Furrowing your brows, you turned your body away from him, closing your legs. &amp;ldquo;Oh, shut it,&amp;rdquo; you grumbled. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="https://40.media.tumblr.com/0936a5342ba8a8e54b1968d4f55fe3d3/tumblr_inline_nle2cxnEX61rowsv9_400.png" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;In the midst of the make-out session, he had somehow removed &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; clothes as well as his&amp;hellip; Or maybe you had helped him reflexively. Either way, it still came as a surprise. You thought you had gotten rid of that habit of zoning out years ago, but apparently you were far from immune against the damned bedhead.&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;Giving you another peck on your forehead, Kuroo reached off to the side to get out a condom from the nightstand. He ripped the wrapper open with his mouth, eager to get things started, but gave you a glance as he hovered over the tip of his manhood.&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hm?&amp;rdquo; he inquired cutely, seeing how you hadn&amp;rsquo;t bothered to fix up your hair. There was no point, because it was just going to get messy again anyway.&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;&amp;ldquo;Seriously,&amp;rdquo; you griped, both defiance and desire in your voice. &amp;ldquo;Put that thing away,&amp;rdquo; you mumbled, averting your gaze once more. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="https://41.media.tumblr.com/ae7e5b4503471e1328a65d31f781f386/tumblr_inline_nle2d2dwjm1rowsv9_500.png" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;&amp;ldquo;Which thing?&amp;rdquo; he teased. &amp;ldquo;This thing?&amp;rdquo; Playfully, he waved the rubber about. &amp;ldquo;Ah, _____, you know I&amp;rsquo;d make a great father, and I&amp;rsquo;d really love to see my own little hyperactive clone running around, but you have school to worry ab&amp;ndash;&amp;rdquo; you interrupted him with a punch to the face.&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m talking about the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; thing!&amp;rdquo; you screeched, leaving him writhing in pain. &amp;ldquo;And, yeah, I have school to worry about&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; you dragged, gulping. You fought against the urge to look down, but failed.&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;&amp;hellip;The other thing, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;indeed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;Kuroo slid on the condom, recovering rather quickly, as you were still weak from earlier and hadn&amp;rsquo;t put any real strength behind the blow. Afterwards, he drew you up against him, erection pressed firmly against your thighs.&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;You looked up at him to meet his hungry gaze. Suffice to say, studying was the last thing on your mind now. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="https://36.media.tumblr.com/3cab3dee0c35b2260258479fb1188bd8/tumblr_inline_nle2d7aveW1rowsv9_400.png" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;Kuroo pulled your legs apart with menial effort as you could no longer think of a reason to deny each other any imminent pleasure. His erection now between your legs, he teased you with a brush of his shaft against your lips.&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;You found yourself lift your lower body to rub against him, eager to get things started. He let you try a few times until you gave up, falling back on the cushion with a soft thud. Teeth gritted, you cursed at him.&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;He let out a chuckle before taking in a deep breath through his nose, and you observed his casual expression change to one of hunger. He steadied himself, rocking so you could feel him brushing back and forth along your folds, just touching the sensitive flesh, readying himself.&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;You gasped with intense pleasure as he slid into you, spreading you open in one smooth thrust. Wrapping your arms around his back, you shuddered against him as your hands gripped his shoulders.&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;You felt every inch of Kuroo as he drove himself slowly in and out of you. The pace quickened and you tried to hold in the sensations coursing through your body. But all of a sudden, he stopped and begun to pull himself out. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="https://36.media.tumblr.com/91be8df3688983856db349778a3a8830/tumblr_inline_nle2dg8lzo1rowsv9_500.png" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;&amp;ldquo;K-Kuroo!&amp;rdquo; you cried, grabbing onto him in desperation. &amp;ldquo;You can&amp;rsquo;t just stop!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;The look on his face said &amp;ldquo;watch me,&amp;rdquo; and so you did, jaw dropped in outrage.&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;He coolly lay on his back, grunting slightly before speaking, &amp;ldquo;Do you remember the last time you called me by my first name?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;&amp;ldquo;Uh,&amp;rdquo; you started with a gape, &amp;ldquo;um, well&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; You squirmed, biting your lower lip in agitation. &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know! We&amp;rsquo;ve come so far, let&amp;rsquo;s just do it!&amp;rdquo; you shouted, pouncing on top of him like he were some catnip.&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;You threw a leg over Kuroo&amp;rsquo;s hard stomach, sitting down and knocking the wind out of him. You grabbed his cock firmly in your hand, causing him to yelp in surprise. Your back was to him because, as eager as you currently seemed and as bold as you were about to be, you were still far too self-conscious.&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;&amp;ldquo;Actually, I guess I do remember,&amp;rdquo; you muttered, adjusting the condom and twiddling with the tip.&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh, really?&amp;rdquo; he breathed, and you felt him slowly slide his hands onto your hips. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="https://40.media.tumblr.com/0bcf9a49c32aa73dc1447a77c934e06e/tumblr_inline_nle2dk8YqH1rowsv9_500.png" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;Grinning, you continued, &amp;ldquo;During our first time.&amp;rdquo; You stood up onto your knees and guided him to your opening. &amp;ldquo;Right, Tetsu?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;His cock sprung to new life and you sank down onto him, and you could feel your inner walls contract around his length.&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;&amp;ldquo;A-ah, Tetsu~!&amp;rdquo; you yelped, shuddering violently even before he was fully inside you. You felt a flush starting from your belly which spread up to your chest. The last inch of Kuroo entered you, pushing against your G-spot, and he grabbed your waist, gasping in pleasure as you began to buck your hips. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="https://40.media.tumblr.com/1f5c970212e2172953e626f9e0b447e5/tumblr_inline_nle2dpFh2w1rowsv9_400.png" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;Eventually, Kuroo took hold of your wrists, thrusting swiftly to meet your every stroke. When you arched your back even further, he pulled you down to rest against his chest. He reached up to caress your breasts and pinch at your poking nipples. Then he ran a hand along your belly and hips. Trailing his fingers down further along you, he stopped at your pink bud to play with it. You went rigid, crying out from the sensation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="https://40.media.tumblr.com/eb3964ddd4814cf8eab3a0b0579f164f/tumblr_inline_nle2dujd6Q1rowsv9_500.png" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;It was not long before your squeals became louder and Kuroo also grunted in complement of your cries at each slap of skin against skin. Head thrown back, you felt your heart pound in your chest as you reached your arms around his neck, pulling the bedhead closer. You kissed him, mumbling his first name again and again, which drove him crazy to fuck you mercilessly. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="https://36.media.tumblr.com/151ba77933896dffd07af6031b480291/tumblr_inline_nle2dzG0FI1rowsv9_500.png" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;Soon, you broke off the kiss with laboured breath, focusing your energy on rocking your hips to meet his every effort, taking in every inch of his length. Kuroo continued to pound into you, feeling a tension gathering inside of him and knowing that a similar pressure grew inside of you. You felt him start to shake and you knew he was near his own climax. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.imgur.com/gtKtaL7.gif" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;Kuroo stiffened, and in response you squeezed him, eager for your own release. Swearing, he plunged into you one final time with a growl, his seed swelling the tip of the condom buried deep within your depths. You felt him swell and throb, and you screamed his name as his convulsions pushed you over the edge. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="https://40.media.tumblr.com/b1e2884981cbda4c62ddfff0e5af257c/tumblr_inline_nle2g8W62u1rowsv9_500.png" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;Gripping the condom between his fingers, Kuroo withdrew from you. He threw it off to the side without a care and slumped back down onto the cushions, letting out a satisfied sigh while wrapping his arms around you. You would&amp;rsquo;ve dozed off without a care in the world if not for the ringing of a phone.&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;&amp;ldquo;GODDAMMIT, KUROO!!!&amp;rdquo; you screamed, flailing your arms about. Accidentally elbowing your boyfriend in the gut, you fell off the couch and hit the hard floor. There was no time for apologies, though, as you put on your clothes and looked around frantically for your textbook, all the while combing your hair with your hands.&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;Kuroo sighed, &amp;ldquo;Is that mine? I&amp;rsquo;ll get&amp;ndash;&amp;rdquo; Interrupted, as you had just thrown his pants at his face, he reached into his pockets with a grumble, flipping the crying device open.&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;Before he could mutter a &amp;ldquo;hello,&amp;rdquo; angry shouting could be heard from the other end. &amp;ldquo;Stop fornicating and do some work, you harlots!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;&amp;ldquo;How did you&amp;hellip;?! Tell that to Kuroo!&amp;rdquo; you screamed in the direction of the phone. &amp;ldquo;And you&amp;rsquo;re not the boss of me, Tomoyo!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not the one with a scholarship on the line!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;&amp;ldquo;I know that! I&amp;rsquo;m handling my own business just fine, thank you!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;As you and your cousin continued to exchange heated words, Kuroo decided against putting the phone on speaker and placed it on the floor. Everything was already a mess, so he decided to take care of it all later. He reached over to the drawers to locate the naked pillows from earlier and placed one on each side of his head, deciding that it was the perfect time to take his nap.&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;br&gt;Some things never changed&amp;hellip;&lt;br&gt;</p>
